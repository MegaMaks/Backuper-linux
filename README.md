# Backuper-linux

Backuper-service

The program is a linux service that allows you to create full and differential backup copies of data on network storages and FTP servers. The service receives settings from the MS SQL server. The results of the backup are sent to the server and the monitoring program informs you of the success or failure of the backup task.
